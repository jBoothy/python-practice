# Interest Calculator - Bailey's Homework

month = int(input("How many months? "))
year_tax_rate = float(input("What is your yearly tax rate? "))
yearly_to_monthly = float(year_tax_rate / 100 / 12)
monthly_tax = float((200 * yearly_to_monthly) * month)
base_per_month = int(200 * month)
total = float(base_per_month) + monthly_tax
print(f"Your total will be: ${round(total,2)}.")
